# Tone Sphere

This is not your usual readme.

I am a guitarist, and I recently bought an audio interface, only to find out that playing or recording guitar requires me to pay again.
Honestly it was all cool and all, but I use Guitar Rig, which already is an expensive piece of software, not to mention the guitar itself is expensive enough, now I have a microphone and an audio interface.
But then comes the audio software bs that comes with it.
I was bored and frustated. I tried both Voicemeeter and Odeus Asio Link Pro.
Voicemeeter ran great, until it asked me to donate again and again, it felt a lot intrusive. I mean, why would I wait for 5 minutes if it is a donationware? Ffs it's donation ware, you either ask nicely or leave, not make people wait.
When I still waited, it became high latency out of nowhere. With VB audio cable of course.
Then I tried odeus asio link pro with asio. And honestly bro, wtf. That stuff was ancient and still no alternative to the date, it was an absolute chad.
But tbh I didn't like the approach, it was too complicated for beginners to grasp, to steep of a curve to just plug your guitar in to your audio interface and start playing.
I've had enough, so being a coder myself, I coded one on my own.

This project is all about that.

## Setup
Just run `pip install uv` if you already don't have `uv` installed.
Then run `uv sync`. That will install everything.

Next just run `uv run audio_engine_backend.py gui` and baby you're gonna love it.

P.S. This is not a rickroll.
I'll work on executables in the future, for now I am busy working in corporate. Inviting others to contribute.
Have fun.
